In 2012 I was working in an ancient coppice forest in West Wales, cutting and restoring old coppice stools of oak. Over the top of these grew large "standards", trees with spreading canopies that shade the coppice stems and cause them to grow straight. Someone remarked that these were on 180-year rotation, and since then I have been curious about what causes us to invest in the long term to such an extent, and how that has changed over time.
