I'm often drawn to social problems that other people avoid, which has led me repeatedly to the waste industry. In 2011, I worked on a Gates Foundation project to design a better composting toilet using worms, and since then I have been in and out of landfills, sewage plants, recycling centres and biogas plants, much of it via R&D at an Icelandic environmental engineering firm. This included a bizarre experience of presenting at the 2017 World's Fair in Astana, Kazakhstan, on the topic of waste-plastic modified asphalt.
