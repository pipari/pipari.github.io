In 2016, during the Panama Papers protests that brought down the government of Iceland, it become obvious that there was a need for a grassroots social centre - all non-party politics was at this time either organised on facebook, in private homes, or in cafés. It also quickly became apparent that, while France's [_nuits debouts_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuit_debout) movement might be organised from the squares, Iceland's weather did not allow for leisurely outdoor discussion.

[Andrými](https://andrymi.org/) was the result of that, moving from a private house, to a temporary rented space, to a semi-squatted ex-kindergarten, to having a rental contract with the city of Reykjavík. It provides a home for all kinds of grassroots groups organising for a better world, as well as a community bike workshop, darkroom, kitchen, meeting and office facilities and garden.

Decisions are made horizontally at monthly general assemblies and by working groups, and there are no hierarchical positions.
