this is the personal website of Jamie McQuilkin, me. 

_pípari_ is an Icelandic word that means plumber, or piper. In less and more abstract senses, this describes most of the things that I try to do.

Many of the [projects](https://pipari.github.io/projects.html) that I contribute to are related to building social or environmental infrastructure of some kind. This can often be quite physical. Sometimes non-metaphorical plumbing is involved. In other cases, this might involve building organisations or projects, and plumbing connections between social groups.

Pipers, that is to say bagpipers, have an unusual role in many societies, including the one I grew up in. Our purpose has been, and is, to match a music to the needs of people gathered at pivotal communal moments. Sometimes a bit of fomenting is what is needed.
